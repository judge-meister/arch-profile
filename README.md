Files from my archlinux install. I have a choice of either i3-gaps, sway or dwm as a window manager.

## Goals and Issues So Far

I'm trying to make these config/dotfiles compatible between my thinkpad and old macbookpro from 2009. This has its difficulties, in particular the keyboard support on the mac can be a little spotty.  The media keys seem to only be partially recognised, volume and screen brightness keys do not seem to register any XF86 key events.  As a result I've had to switch to using the Fn keys instead, which is fine as I generally don't use the Fn keys for anything else.
